<h2>Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to *study* and *analyze* data?</h2>
<br>
**Daveigh:** Data in large quantities can be analyzed to predict and target decisions made in businesses, healthcare, telecommunications, manufacturing, legislation, activism, and a plethora of other fields. Decisions like making changes to a product or how companies run can be made in response to the evidence and conclusions drawn from data drawn from consumer satisfaction surveys or employee retention rates. <br><br>

**Jasmin:** The reason why we need to study and analyze data is because it helps us make sense of the overwhelming heap of figures at hand and turn it into an essential factor in formulating critical decisions and substantial reports - that of which is pivotal for the advancement of various societal sectors. <br><br>

**Nathan:** We need to be able to study and analyze data because this allows us to understand patterns or probabilities of specific outcomes, allowing us to prepare for the possible outcomes, and/or do something to change the probabilities and patterns such that we can make use of it.<br><br>

**Paolo:** We need to study and analyze data because it allows us to determine the effect and impact of certain things and see how it progresses overtime. For example, on YouTube, I can see data from a video that I've uploaded, including how many people clicked on the video, how many stayed at the end, and of course how many people liked it. Moreover, as a very well-known feature of data on YouTube, you can see how many people who watch your videos are actually subscribed to you. These pieces of data are very helpful especially for YouTube content creators as it allows them to determine what kind of content is worth making and if it's interesting enough for their viewers. <br><br>

**Gena:** Data is informative. For instance, it reflects our preferences, our experiences every day, and the ways we deal with daily encounters. With this, we could use data to support research and studies that could help us better understand and improve our lifestyle. <br>

<h2>Cite at least one *instance* or *application* where *data science* was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.</h2>
<br>
**Daveigh:** Supermarkets like Walmart monitor data across their stores in real-time. The company has a system that monitors performance data throughout their stores and an alert system that triggers when certain indicators lower to a certain level. One example of this system benefitting the company include a period when sales for a certain produce was declining. Because the data on the decline was analyzed immediately the pricing error which caused the decline was corrected right away. Sales for the produce recovered within the week. <br><br>

**Jasmin:** Huge amounts of customer data is being utilized in online shopping applications and platforms to further understand the customers' shopping patterns and preferences and create a customized online shopping environment for them. <br><br>

**Nathan:** Waze makes use of data that has been gathered in the past, and data gathered by other users, to determine traffic in specific areas, and can give a rough estimate given all the attained data on the route.<br><br>

**Paolo:** When one goes on vacation, it may be wise to check the weather of the area you're heading to in order to determine if you need to pack warmer clothes or not. <br><br>

**Gena:** Netflix offers a variety of films and series to watch. In choosing what to watch next, one’s decision may be influenced by what the majority also prefers. <br>

<h2>Propose at least *one data science topic* that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.</h2>
<br>
**Daveigh:** A data science topic that I would want to pursue is using sentiment analysis to understand the depth of polarization occurring in the political landscape of the Philippines. The Philippines is among the top Facebook-using countries in the world where Filipinos also express political insights and sentiments towards national figures, organizations, and issues. These posts circulating Facebook can be mined to analyze people’s political sentiments and the posts they gravitate towards. In turn, this data can be used to make predictions on how echo chambers and polarization occurs within Facebook. A collection of unprocessed documents shall be transformed into a matrix of term frequency vs. inverse document frequency using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) statistical method. This method shall be employed to give value to specific words in posts based on how frequently they are used. Filipinos who can often be exposed to political takes on this platform, whether false or not, can benefit from understanding the political landscape beyond their own tailored feeds.<br><br>

**Jasmin:** The role of data science in game development really caught my interest. The information attained from gaming data is in control of generating mathematical and automated models for studying game optimization points. Data science also plays a critical function in the entire concept of the game, as well as its design and functionality. Thus, studying and analyzing game data will help developers better understand what keeps the players involved and engaged. <br><br>

**Nathan:** A data science topic I would want to pursue would be social media algorithms, as it seems to be very calculated, how videos show up based on our interests and their performance. This means that if you usually watch basketball videos on youtube by a content creator, similar creators with the same content are more often to show up on your recommended page on youtube. Being a social media platform where likes, views, and other engagements are viewed as good, some pieces of data are presented to us right in front of our faces. For this, I would use the correlation method to compare what are the possible reasons for the success of specific videos. With an understanding of this, up and coming influencers and creators would find it easier to get into the scene, and many would learn without having to make the mistakes many others have already.<br><br>

**Paolo:** A data science topic that I'd like to explore would be the relationship between the rise and fall of cryptocurrency on the market price for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or graphics cards for computers. As cryptocurrency seems to be a hot and controversial topic lately, it wouldn't be very difficult to look at the trends of the rising and falling prices of cryptocurrency. Moreover, because graphics cards are used directly to "mine" or produce cryptocurrency, it wouldn't be so difficult to look at the prices of these during the period in which certain cryptocurrencies were at their peak or trough. I think it would certainly benefit people who have a hobby for building their own computers as it would allow them to determine the best times to buy high-end graphics cards for their custom PCs.<br><br>

**Gena:** Concerning the rise of e-commerce, tracking online shopping orders is appealing to me. Determining the places where orders are frequently shipped would help in tracking the "hotspots" of generated parcel packaging waste. In doing so, we could help The Plaf—an enterprise that collects plastic waste and up-cycles it into new sustainable products—establish new drop-off points that would encourage more online shoppers to donate their package waste.
